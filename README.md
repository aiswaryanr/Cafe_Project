# Cafe_Project
The Caf√© Order Management System is a project that utilizes the Python programming language as the front end and MySQL as the back end. It enables the collection and management of product details based on customer preferences and calculates the total cost of the orders. This system is particularly useful in real-life scenarios, such as small cafes or restaurants, as it reduces manual work and minimizes calculation errors.

The project involves the creation of two database tables: "MENU" and "CUSTOMERS." The "MENU" table stores information about various food items, including their IDs, names, and prices. The "CUSTOMERS" table stores records of customer orders, including the food ID, name, number of servings, and corresponding prices.

The program allows users to input food items from the menu along with the desired number of servings. It then calculates the total amount for the order and displays a summary of the order details. The system ensures the accurate selection of food items by utilizing binary search algorithms to match the entered food ID with the available options in the menu.

By connecting Python with MySQL, this project streamlines the ordering process, reduces errors, and enhances efficiency in cafes or small restaurants.
